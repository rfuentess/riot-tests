This is a test application for the TLSMAN Module [Currently PR #9066](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/9066)

Please, reminds that this module is not intended to be used directly by the user, but by means of another module. These examples are just to show the simplicity in relation to the client/server sides on the dtls-echo example.
